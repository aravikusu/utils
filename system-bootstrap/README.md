# system-bootstrap
A script that will set up "essentials" for me whenever I decide that I have to re-install my system.

Development tools, terminal configs, that sort of stuff.

At the moment only Linux and MacOS is supported since those are the only operative systems I use.
Linux support is relegated to distros I've used. Will add more as I use more.
